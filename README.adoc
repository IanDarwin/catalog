= esCatalog

Take pictures of things and catalog them.
Allows multiple pix per item, a brief description,
and an estimated valuation.

Useful for estate sales, downsizing, etc.
Hence the name: escatalog can mean:

* Estate Sale Catalog
* Extra Stuff Catalog
* ex's stuff Catalog

Very much a WIP for now.
